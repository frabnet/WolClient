# WolClient

This is a PowerShell script to simplify power on of remote computers while connected via OpenVPN/pfSense VPN.  
End user just need to run the script, follow instructions and wait for RDP to come up.  
Make users happy and save the planet :blossom:

Now also [available for Linux](https://github.com/frabnet/WolClient-Linux)! üêß

## pfSense setup / server side

- Setup OpenVPN Server as you like.
  Hint: providing a DNS Server able to resolve dhcp clients hostnames can simplify things.
- Setup the firewall to allow OpenVPN clients reach pfSense (https) and the remote computer (rdp).
- Create a Wake On Lan user, without a certificate (it's not used in OpenVPN).
- Edit the Wake On Lan user, set "WebCfg - Services: Wake-on-LAN" under "Effective Privileges".
